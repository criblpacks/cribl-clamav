        Brute force time change =======

        If the time is off by something close to a 30 minute boundary, add the snapped 30 minute boundary count to _time. 'Close' means +/- 10 seconds by default. Adjust as needed in the filter of the 2nd eval of Main Group.


        Example: If 'now() - _time' is off by +3600.230, that's 2 30 minute sections, and it's very close (230 ms). In this case, we'll add exactly 3600 to _time.


        Example: 'now() - _time' is off by -1801 seconds. We will subtract 1800 seconds from _time.


        Example: 'now() - _time' is off by 603 seconds. No change will be made as it's not close to a multiple of 1800.
